Project Description: 3D Name Generator

Project Title: 3D Name Generator

Objective:
The 3D Name Generator is a simple web application designed to visually transform user-inputted names into striking 3D text effects. It allows users to customize how their name appears by choosing from a variety of pre-defined 3D styles, each adding depth and character to the text.

Features:

    Real-time Text Input: As the user types their name into the input field, the displayed name updates instantly.
    Multiple 3D Styles: Users can choose from different 3D effects, such as shadows, gradients, perspective tilts, neon glows, and retro designs.
    Interactive UI: The application is user-friendly, with a clean interface that provides an intuitive experience for users of all ages.
    Responsive Design: The application is fully responsive, ensuring that the display and input elements look great on any device, whether desktop or mobile.

Technologies Used:

    HTML: Provides the structure of the application, including input fields, a dropdown menu, and the display area for the 3D name.
    CSS: Utilizes CSS techniques such as shadows, gradients, transformations, and text effects to create the 3D visual styles.
    JavaScript: Handles user input and dynamically applies the selected 3D style to the text, making the application interactive.

Use Cases:

    Personalization: Users can personalize their names with various 3D effects, making it a fun tool for creating unique name tags, digital signatures, or social media graphics.
    Learning Tool: This project serves as an excellent learning resource for beginners looking to understand the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, particularly in the context of creating dynamic, visually engaging web content.

How It Works:

    The user enters their name into an input field.
    The user selects a desired 3D style from a dropdown menu.
    The application instantly updates the displayed name with the chosen 3D effect.

This project is perfect for anyone interested in web design and development, offering a hands-on experience in combining different web technologies to create a visually appealing and interactive tool.
